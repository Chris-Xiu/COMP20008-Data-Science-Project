We didn't realize we need to follow the link to create the repository under the class "COMP20008", so instead we created our own private one. Here are the links for both repositories as the pirvate one contains all of our commit histories. (The contents in both repositories are the same)
- Private github reposotpry: https://github.com/Chris-Xiu/COMP20008A2

Package required to run the code:
- pandas

- matplotlib
- descartes
- geopandas
- scipy
- numpy
- shapely
- sklearn
